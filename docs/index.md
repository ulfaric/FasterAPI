# FasterAPI

As the name suggested, this is a open source project that aims to make [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) more easier to use, aka `Faster!` Although FastAPI is a fantastic framework, it troubles me that it does not include a authentication pipeline. Hence, I created this project which builts a JWT autehntication pipeline as the offcial documentation suggested. Additionally, some important configuration are linked with environment variables & yaml files for convenience.

Please feel free to use it as the baseline for your next project!

We have been using it as a quick startup for our projects at [Innovation Centre Perth](https://www.icentralau.com.au/perth/). Welcome all visitors!
