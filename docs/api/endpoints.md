# Built-in Endpoints

FastAPI automatically generated a endpoints documentation page based on swagger. You can access it via <http://IP:PORT/docs>, where `IP` and `PORT` is defined in your script that starts the server with uvicorn. `/docs` is the default URL, if you did not set `DOCS_URL` in your `meta_config.yaml`.
